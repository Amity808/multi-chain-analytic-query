NEXT_PUBLIC_NODIT_API_KEY=your_nodit_api_key_here

# OpenAI API Key (for AI analytics)
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. API Keys Setup

#### Nodit API

1. Sign up at [Nodit.io](https://nodit.io)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add to environment variables

#### OpenAI API

1. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an API key
3. Add to environment variables

### 3. Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Usage

### Accessing AI Analytics

1. **From Main Dashboard**: Click the "AI Analytics" tab
2. **Direct URL**: Navigate to `/ai-analytics`

### Generating AI Insights

1. **Enter Wallet Address**: Input the wallet address you want to analyze
2. **Select Blockchain**: Choose the blockchain network (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
3. **Choose Analysis Type**: Select from the five analysis types
4. **Generate Analysis**: Click "Generate AI Analysis"

### Understanding Results

Each analysis provides:

- **Confidence Score**: How reliable the AI prediction is (0-100%)
- **Insights**: Detailed analysis data in JSON format
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for your portfolio
- **Warnings**: Potential risks or concerns to be aware of

## Technical Architecture

### AI Analytics Engine

```typescript
class AIAnalyticsEngine {
  // Collects market data from Nodit API
  private async collectMarketData(address: string, chain: string);

  // Generates AI insights using OpenAI GPT-4
  private async generateAIInsight(analysisType: string, marketData: any);

  // Builds specialized prompts for each analysis type
  private buildAnalysisPrompt(analysisType: string, marketData: any);

  // Provides fallback analysis when AI is unavailable
  private generateFallbackAnalysis(analysisType: string, marketData: any);
}
```

### Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Nodit API provides portfolio and transaction data
2. **Data Processing**: Raw blockchain data is cleaned and structured
3. **AI Analysis**: GPT-4 analyzes the data with specialized prompts
4. **Result Presentation**: Insights are displayed in an intuitive UI

### Error Handling

- **API Failures**: Graceful fallback to basic analysis
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Invalid Data**: Validation and error messages
- **Network Issues**: Offline mode with cached data

## API Integration

### Nodit API Endpoints Used

- `getTokensOwned()`: Portfolio token holdings
- `getTransfers()`: Transaction history
- `getTokenPrices()`: Current price data

### OpenAI API Integration

- **Model**: GPT-4
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **Max Tokens**: 2000
- **System Prompt**: Crypto analytics expert role

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Wallet addresses are processed locally
- No personal data is stored permanently
- API keys are kept secure in environment variables

### Rate Limiting

- OpenAI API calls are rate-limited
- Nodit API calls are optimized for efficiency
- Fallback mechanisms prevent service disruption

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- Analysis results are cached temporarily
- Portfolio data is refreshed on demand
- Price data is cached for 5 minutes

### Loading States

- Progress indicators for long-running analyses
- Skeleton loading for UI components
- Graceful degradation for slow networks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"AI analysis temporarily unavailable"**

   - Check OpenAI API key configuration
   - Verify API quota and billing
   - Check network connectivity

2. **"Failed to collect market data"**

   - Verify Nodit API key
   - Check wallet address format
   - Ensure blockchain network is supported

3. **Low confidence scores**
   - Insufficient transaction history
   - Limited price data available
   - New or illiquid tokens

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by adding to your browser console:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("debug", "ai-analytics");
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Advanced Analytics**

   - DeFi protocol analysis
   - NFT portfolio insights
   - Cross-chain correlation analysis

2. **Machine Learning Integration**
